This project is about a  idea which got to me.

IDEA:

English can be learned in many ways, one of the way is describing the picture  or writing about that picture in 50 words and correcting it with a professional Teacher.

As AI is evolving, I taken chatgpt as the teacher so after you write 50 words , you can send the picture to AI and compare how AI returns it, based on it  you can learn english.
